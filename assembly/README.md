# X86 general purpose registers

1. EAX (Accumulator Register)
    EAX is commonly used to hold function return values, as well as the first argument to a function.
    It can also be used as a general-purpose register for arithmetic and logic operations.
2. ECX (Counter Register)
    ECX is commonly used as a loop counter or as the second argument to a function.
3. EDX (Data Register)
    EDX is commonly used as a general-purpose register for arithmetic and logic operations, as well
    as to hold the upper 32 bits of a 64-bit value.
4. EBX (Base Register)
    EBX is commonly used as a general-purpose register for memory access and as a base pointer for
    memory access instructions
5. ESP (Stack Register)
    ESP is commonly used to keep track of the top of the stack in memory.
6. EBP (Base Pointer Register)
    EBP is commonly used as a base pointer for stack-based memory access instructions.
7. ESI (Source Index Register)
    ESI can also be used as a generatl-purpose register for memory access, as well as for arithmetic
    and logic operations.
8. EDI (Destination Index Register)
    EDI is commonly used as a destination pointer for string operations.
