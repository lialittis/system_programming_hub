# JSON Parser

## Simple example

In this example, the JSON file represents a person's information. It includes properties such as 
name, age, city, employment status, hobbies (stored in an array), and an address object with nested
properties.

As you develop your custom JSON parser, you can start by **extracting** and **displaying** the 
values of these properties. Expand the parser's functionality by handling nested structures,
different data types, and more complex JSON files based on your requirements.
